						<b>	Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These
						shifts may be natural such as variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s,
						human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning
						fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
						Greenhouse gas concentrations are at their highest levels in 2 million years and emissions
						continue to rise. As a result, the Earth is now about 1.1Â°C warmer than it was in the late
						1800s. The last decade was the warmest on record.
						The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water
						scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms
						and declining biodiversity.
						Given the scenario, Hackathon team invites ideas related to what software solutions can be
						developed to curb or reduce or slow down this process.
						Solutions can be in the area of (not limited to) reporting,reducing the consumption,
						recycling, circular economy and disaster response.</b></p>
